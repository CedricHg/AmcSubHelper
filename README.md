# AmcSubHelper
.NET Framework 4.8 Winforms application

Intended for usage with the game "The AMC Squad"

This tool allows you to import an .OGG file and write and fix subtitle timings as you're listening to it.
Work can be saved and loaded via an ".amcsubproj" file (which is just a JSON file).

Use the Export to CON menu item to export the subtitle timings to CON code that can then be implemented in the game's scripts.
